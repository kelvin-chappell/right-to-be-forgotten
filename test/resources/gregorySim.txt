Couple arrested for 'having sex' on crowded train

By Daily Mail Reporter
Updated: 10:48, 11 November 2008




A couple have been arrested for allegedly having sex in a crowded train carriage.

Other passengers en route from Liverpool to London appear to have sat in embarrassed silence as the 41-year-old woman allegedly committed a sex act on her male partner.
The pair were arrested by police on arrival at Euston station. Officers are believed to have been called after a guard on the Virgin intercity train spotted the couple on CCTV.

A man has been charged and a woman bailed for allegedly having sex on a crowded Virgin train, like this one
Businessman Gregory Sim, 49, has been charged with unacceptable behaviour while the unnamed woman, from Essex, has been bailed while inquiries continue.
A spokesman for British Transport Police said the session took place on Wednesday, October 22, at 2.45pm.
'The man, Gregory Sim, from Richmond, Surrey, has been charged with unacceptable behaviour on a train and is due to appear at City of Westminster magistrates on November 16,' he added.
Quizzed by reporters last night, Mr Sim confirmed his arrest but refused to give any more details.
